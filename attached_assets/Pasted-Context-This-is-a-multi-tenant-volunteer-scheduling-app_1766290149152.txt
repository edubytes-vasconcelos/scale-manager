Context:
This is a multi-tenant volunteer scheduling app using:
- React + Vite (frontend)
- Supabase (Auth + Database + RLS)
- A volunteers table that links users to organizations (churches)

Problem to solve:
The onboarding flow is incomplete. A user who logs in may be in one of three situations:
1) Already exists as a volunteer (email already registered, auth_user_id is null)
2) Does not exist as a volunteer, but may belong to an existing church
3) Wants to create a new church and become admin

Rules (DO NOT BREAK THESE):
- NEVER automatically create a church
- Creating a church must be an explicit user action
- Do NOT refactor unrelated code
- Do NOT change database schema unless explicitly required
- Keep changes minimal and localized

Required behavior:
After login:
1) Call an RPC (claim_profile) to link auth.uid() to an existing volunteer by email
2) Fetch the current user volunteer profile
3) If a volunteer profile exists:
   - Enter the application normally
4) If NO volunteer profile exists:
   - Show a "No organization linked" screen with two options:
     a) "I already belong to a church" (shows informational message only)
     b) "Create a new church" (explicit action)

Create new church flow:
- When the user chooses "Create a new church":
  - Ask only for church name
  - Call an RPC create_church_and_admin(church_name)
  - This RPC must:
    * Create the organization
    * Create a volunteer linked to auth.uid()
    * Set role = 'admin' and can_lead = true
  - Refresh the auth session
  - Reload app state and enter normally

Implementation instructions:
- Add a simple React screen for "No organization linked"
- Integrate this logic into the existing App.tsx / loadData flow
- Use existing Supabase client and routing
- Do NOT introduce new libraries
- Keep UI minimal and functional

Goal:
Close the onboarding flow so that:
- Existing volunteers are linked automatically
- New users are never forced to create a church
- Church creation is always an explicit decision
